## General info
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data theyâ€™ve been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.
This project performs the extraction and transformation of data coming from user activity logs from Sparkify's music streaming app. In addition, It has created a project to model the NoSQL database using Apache Cassandra according to the queries requested for startup Sparkify.

## Technologies
The project is created with:
* Python version: 3.8.8
* Jupyter lab: 3.0.14
* Apache Cassandra version: 3.11.0

## Files
The project contains this files
* etl.py: This file contains the code responsible for modeling the NoSQLdatabase, extracting data from data sources, transforming them and loading them into the database.

## Setup
